Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Mods and Plugins for Minecraft Fabric
Step 1: Install Java

Minecraft and its mods are built on Java, so the first step is to ensure you have the latest version of Java installed. You can download it from the official Java website.

    Visit the Java download page.
    Click on the download button for the Java version compatible with your operating system.
    Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the on-screen instructions to install Java.

Step 2: Download and Install the Fabric Installer

Fabric requires its own installer, which you can get from the Fabric website.

    Navigate to the Fabric website.

    Click on “Use” in the navigation bar.

    Download the Fabric installer by clicking on the “Universal/.JAR” file link.

    After downloading, double-click the .jar file to run the installer.
    For Windows, you might need to right-click the file and choose "Open with" -> "Java(TM) Platform SE binary".

Step 3: Install the Fabric Loader

Using the Fabric Installer:

    Open the Fabric Installer.
    In the window that opens, select the “Client” tab.
    Choose the Minecraft version you wish to mod from the dropdown menu.
    Ensure the "Create Profile" option is checked.
    Click on “Install”. This will install the Fabric loader and create a new profile in your Minecraft launcher.
